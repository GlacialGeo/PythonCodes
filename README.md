# PythonCodes
In this repository, you will find python scripts (as Jupyter Notebooks) that can be use in teaching and/or research. They are specifically built for data analysis related to glacial geology, sedimentology, and geochemistry. There is also a data folder, which contains some of the data used in the notebooks (other datasets are located elsewhere such as on government websites).
